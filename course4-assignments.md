### WEEK 1 Sequences and Prediction
#### Quiz 1
- Time Series
  - Univariate time series : single value at each time step.
    - ex. Hour by hour temperature

  - Multivariate time series : multiple values at each time step.
    -  ex. Hour by hour weather

- `impuation` : A projection of unknown (usually past or missing) data

- A sound wave is a good example of time series data (True)
- `Seasonality` : A regular change in shape of the data. 
  - seen when patterns repeat at predictable intervals. 
- `Trend` : An overall direction for data regardless of direction
  - where time series have a specific direction that they're moving in. 
- `Noise` (In the context of time series) : Unpredictable changes in time series data
- `Autocorrelation` : Data that follows a predictable shape, even if the scale is different
  - Namely it correlates with a delayed copy of itself often called a lag. 
- `non-stationary` time series : One that has a disruptive event breaking trend and seasonality
  - the optimal time window that you should use for training will vary. 
  - stationary, meaning its behavior does not change over time.
